# enviable

A user-friendly way of configuring Clojure apps with environment variables.

## Goals

- An app should document the configuration it requires.
- Useful, user-friendly feedback should be provided for missing configuration.
- The app should only request the config it actually needs.
- Configuration requirements should be composable.
- Configuration should be describable with simple Clojure data.

## Usage

### Defining config
- `var`
- `read-env`
- `parse-with`
- `default-to`
- `is-optional`
- `describe`
- `error?`

### Types
- `int-var`
- `double-var`
- `bool-var`

### CLI Output
- `cli/read-env`

### Configuring Components
- `Configurable / configuration`
- `configure-system`

## Examples
- `lein examples.basic`
- `lein examples.component
